# amazon-hq2

My speculation on the motivation for Amazon's second headquarters:

 1) They are hedging their bets with Seattle. Amazon wants to stay in business even if Seattle “goes out of business”
 -e.g. a doomsday scenario where everything in Seattle is lost-e.g. because of an earthquake, other natural disaster, etc. or if North Korea nuked Seattle. 

 2) Are there some things that aren’t working as well as they wish, in Seattle? Perhaps they are they looking for a compliment to Seattle rather than a clone of Seattle? 

 3) Perhaps, it is a questions of taxation or labor laws. Perhaps Amazon even wants to influence Congress?	

 There are a LOT of different types of analysis we could do here. We need to have a clear hypothesis for Amazon’s approach. 
 My hypothesis: Amazon wants to “clone itself.” It is using the general demographics in Seattle and matching it with the demographics of its finalists. 

 The basis of my analysis is that we can compare the demographics of Seattle and e.g. Atlanta and Boston, and see how they fit together. 

 Inevitably this is not the final word on Amazon's HQ2. It would be impossible to carry out every aspect of this analysis but I can still show some meaningful analysis. Here’s what I’m trying to show you: 1) some fundamental statistics such as t-test and f-test 2) examples of unsupervised analysis: k-means and hiearchichal clusters and 3) an example of supervised analysis: and random forest.
